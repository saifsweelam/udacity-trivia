# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a  webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game.

This application has the following features:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 


## Dependencies and Running tips

There are tips to run the application inside the READMEs in:

1. [`./frontend/`](./frontend/README.md)
2. [`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)


## About the Stack


### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a partially completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. You will read primarily app.py to see defined endpoints and can reference models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup. 

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.

[View the README.md within ./frontend for more details.](./frontend/README.md)
